# What is this?

This is my submission for my "Testing and Reliable Software Engineering" undergrad module. 

We were given a fictional software specification which we could write a testing plan for, but in typical ADHD fashion I find working without an actually real project a nightmare. Fortunately we could instead talk about testing our own undergrad thesis projects, although it was advised against as previous years' students did so poorly... of course, I decided to use my own project.

I'm incredibly proud of the testing strategy I devised, but it is somewhat an awkward fit with the learning contents of the module thanks to my heavy use of Hypothesis. Hypothesis is an incredible tool, bringing about many disparate testing ideas into a tangible, actually-easy-to-use product. I could not find any literature which discussed how property-based testing touched upon agile testing quadrants, so had to mention more specific ideas that it incorperates.

I started of this submission by copy-pasting the testing section in my [thesis report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Honno/coinflip/report/report.pdf). I ended up having to rework a lot so that this testing-only report would make sense, and the process ended up being a good exercise in how to communicate coinflip's testing strategy succintly.
